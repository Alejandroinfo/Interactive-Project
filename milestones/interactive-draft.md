## Goal

My current goal is to help the user find the best game for them which them based
on what information they have or games they have played before.

## Data Challenges

Yes two issues: One is that currently the data source I got my information from
is only updated till 2021 and I wished I had it till 2025. However scraping would
take too much time.
Second the description has already been processed and lematize which means that
currently the only thing I can display is a rumble of words.


## Walk Through

My interaction is like this first we have the main site:
Add a game you have played before and just search. If you have any requirements
just add it to the filter( it would only look in the preloaded 200 hundred 
best matches)
If you have no idea you can click the button in help to find a game which will 
pop up some question about what kind of games you would like to find. Based on it
it will randomize one of the 20k games that matches your filter and it will give
it to you.

Now that you have the matches you can either click on them and see why it was matched
There is also link to extra information on the main site bgg.com as well as a link
to amazon to buy the game. You can also try to update the base game to this one

There are two other tabs one with the main graph and the ssecond one is more 
common graphs called other graphs. In the main graph you can see the matches as 
which you can click on the node to change to analize that as a base game or the
link to see a comparison between both of them. Just for fun you can also drag
it around. It also has colors based on the uniqueness that relates them to the 
base game

In other graphs, we can see some graphs of the matches like the  average rating
density, mechanics they used, themes most common as well as when they were published 

## Questions

{Numbered list of questions for course staff, if any.}

1. More than anything I would love to make more meaningful graphs and also
add the option to look for more game like this based on some seleccion like
more fromn Uwe Rosenberg or more in this mechanic. Currently you get the matches
but it might not be specifically what is easier if you just want to jump using 
this help
2. Also Im having a problem with the weightness of the json files I can only 
upload the best 300 matches before it collapses. But also adding the function 
to look it at the moment could slow down the website which I dont want. So 
any suggestion about that

Thanks you very much
